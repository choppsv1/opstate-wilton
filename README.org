* draft-wilton-netmod-opstate-yang

** Abstract

   This document proposes a possible alternative solution for handling applied
   configuration state in YANG as described in
   draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01. The proposed solution, roughly modelled
   on the with-defaults NETCONF/RESTCONF capability, aims to meet the key
   requirements set out in draft-ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs-01 without the need
   for YANG module authors to explicitly duplicate configuration nodes in both
   configuration and operational containers. This draft does not address the
   issue of co-location of configuration and operational state for interfaces,
   nor does it provide a NETCONF mechanism to retrieve operational data
   separately from configuration data.

** Status
   This is a work in progress by the authors.
